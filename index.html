Los Angeles based artist Dominic Santosâ€™s practice emphasises ephemeral and  mystical elements in sculptural designs and multidisciplinary explorations of light projection and collage. Often working in collaboration with live musicians, his abstract compositions are explored performatively through the reworking of colored acetate and found materials with analog slide projectors.
