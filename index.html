Los Angeles based artist Dominic Santosâ€™s multi-disciplinary practice involves sculptural design, collage, light projection, and video. Often working in collaboration with live musicians, abstract compositions are explored performatively through the reworking of colored acetate and found materials over analog slide projectors.
