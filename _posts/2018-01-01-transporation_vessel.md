“Collage allows the opening up of conscious, which is very direct...it’s also a way of looking at what you are consuming all the time.”
-John Stezaker

While living in Berlin, using discarded, “found” materials from my travels in Europe--particularly from sacred sites--e.g., Glastonbury and Stonehenge--I began creating conceptual collages in the form of “bags.” While creating these pieces, I found myself entering subliminal corridors searching for elemental energy and divine symbology to express mystic images, while attempting to harness and to juxtapose opposing dimensions. Four became central to my understanding--i.e., directions, elements. The end result is 4 ordinary objects containing mystic magik.
